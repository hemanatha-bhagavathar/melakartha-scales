# melakartha-scales
C programs explaining the 72 parental scales of carnatic music (melakartha raagas) with simple arrays.

To comple:

$ cc melakartha-scales.c

Notes:

- Read the comments in the above C program for explanation
- I wrote oneliner.c just for kicks ;-) but gives the same output

Enjoy!
